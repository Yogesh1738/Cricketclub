Hey!
This is a onepage cricket academy website created with the help of HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT for front-end. I use node.js for backend, and express.js for back-end web application framework. This website tells about the best performance of the player and the best mentor of the academy and the services delivered by the coaches to the
students. At last their is a form to fill up by the users in order to take the admission in the academy.
I use the MongoDB to save the data in the back-end receiving from the users.
